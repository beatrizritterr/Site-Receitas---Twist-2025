➜ In this lesson, we created a small website with four pages:

⭑ On the index (home) page, we only have the website name (with images) and four links (HOME | Recipe | Video | Contact).

⭑ On the Recipe page, we have a complete description of a recipe and a playlist for the user to listen to.

⭑ On the Video page, we have the video related to the recipe.

⭑ On the Contact page, we created a form applying all the form tags we've learned (input, label, fieldset, legend, datalist, button, select, etc.), arguments (id and name), and attributes (placeholder, size, autofocus, required, value, etc.).
